    "bio": "I have a passion for efficiency and performance. I am an expert in high-reliability, multithreaded and multicore software. I have worked on concurrent data structures, CPU scheduling, threading and distributed systems. I have intimate experience debugging conservative locks, wasteful memory allocations, cache misses and false sharing. If you have weird heisenbugs and race conditions, I can track, test and fix them anywhere in the stack, from the OS kernel to the compiler to the application program itself.",
